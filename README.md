# 📦 Pre-trained Model

The trained **EfficientNet-B4** model is **not stored directly in the repository** to keep the repository lightweight.

You can download the latest pre-trained model from the **GitHub Releases** page.

## Download

➡️ **GitHub Releases:**
https://github.com/AyushmanDhara/SkinGuard-CNN-AI--Skin-Disease-Detection-System/releases/tag/v1.0

Download the following asset:

```text
best_model.pth
```

After downloading, place the model file in the project root directory:

```text
SkinGuard-AI/
│
├── best_model.pth
├── app.py
├── model.py
├── requirements.txt
└── ...
```

The application will automatically load the model during startup.

| Recall          | 92.73%          |

> **Note:** The model is distributed through GitHub Releases because binary model files are not ideal for storing directly in the repository.

# ⚠️ Disclaimer

SkinGuard AI and DrugGPT are intended for educational, research, and demonstration purposes only.

The application does not provide medical diagnoses, prescriptions, or professional healthcare advice. Predictions may contain inaccuracies and should never replace consultation with qualified healthcare professionals.

Always seek advice from licensed medical practitioners regarding diagnosis, treatment, and medication decisions.
